                <p>William Martin Joel (born May 9, 1949) is an American singer, pianist, composer, and songwriter. Commonly nicknamed the "Piano Man" after his signature song of the same name, he has led a commercially successful career as a solo artist since the 1970s, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. Joel's music has been described as a blend of rock, pop, and classical influences, often featuring introspective and storytelling lyrics. His songs frequently explore themes of love, loss, social commentary, and personal struggles.</p><p>Born and raised in the Bronx and later Hicksville, Long Island, New York, Joel's father was a pianist, fostering an early appreciation for music. He began taking piano lessons at a young age and played in local bands during his teens. After dropping out of high school to pursue a musical career, Joel played with several groups, including the Hassles and Attila, before embarking on his solo career. His first solo album, "Cold Spring Harbor," was released in 1971, but due to a mastering error, it was not commercially successful. His breakthrough came with the release of "Piano Man" in 1973, the title track becoming his signature song and a staple in his repertoire. Throughout the 1970s, Joel released a string of successful albums, including "Streetlife Serenade," "Turnstiles," "The Stranger," and "52nd Street," each showcasing his songwriting prowess and musical versatility. "The Stranger" was a critical and commercial triumph, spawning several hit singles and solidifying Joel's status as a major recording artist.</p><p>The 1980s saw Joel continue to dominate the charts with albums such as "Glass Houses," "An Innocent Man," and "The Bridge." "An Innocent Man" was a tribute to the doo-wop and soul music of his youth, featuring hits like "Uptown Girl" and "Tell Her About It." In 1987, Joel performed a historic concert in the Soviet Union, one of the first major American artists to do so during the Cold War. His 1989 album, "Storm Front," included the hit single "We Didn't Start the Fire," a rapid-fire recap of historical events. Joel released his last pop studio album, "River of Dreams," in 1993. Although he hasn't released any new pop/rock albums since then, he continues to tour and perform live, playing sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden and other venues. In 2001, he released an album of classical compositions, "Fantasies & Delusions." Joel has received numerous awards and accolades throughout his career, including six Grammy Awards and induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. His enduring popularity and musical contributions have solidified his legacy as one of the most influential and beloved singer-songwriters of his generation. He continues to inspire musicians and captivate audiences with his timeless songs and dynamic performances. Beyond his musical achievements, Joel has also been involved in various philanthropic endeavors, supporting causes such as music education and environmental conservation.</p>
